<p>Hello,

Iâ€™m Wyatt Dudgeon, a determined Detroit entrepreneur resolute on changing the world. I seek to explore a career in finance or entrepreneurship. I am currently working with the Detroit Techstars Mobility accelerator that invests and develops leading startups across the blossoming mobility space.

In my spare time, I have cofounded both a charity in hopes of bettering both our local and global community. You can read more about my charity (Rturn).

To conclude, I aspire to expand my knowledge within the mobility, tech, financial, and venture capital space through a summer internship summer '19. Contact me if you wish to hear more.

Best regards,
Wyatt</p>
