<p>Hello,

My name is Wyatt Dudgeon. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan at the Ross School of Business pursuing my Bachelors of Business Administration (BBA) with a concentration in Finance and Entrepreneurship.

I seek to explore a career in finance or entrepreneurship. This past summer I had the opportunity to work with the Detroit Techstars Mobility accelerator, the mobility startup accelerator. I aspire to expand my knowledge within the mobility, tech, and financial space through a summer internship summer ‘19

While at Michigan I am presently working on several projects. Firstly, I am working closely with the Genivi Automotive Alliance to compile a database to track the progress of autonomous vehicle development of large automotive manufacturers, technology industry leaders, and first tier suppliers. I am also engaged in research with Dr. David Brophy, the director of venture capital and private equity at the Ross School of Business, in regards to the correlation of high quality mentorship and a startup’s success. Thirdly, I was recently employed as a university analyst at Plug and Play Tech-center, a large network startup accelerator and corporate innovation platform, to deal source Midwestern hardware and advanced mobility solution startups.

Thank you so much for taking the time. If you have any inquiries in regards to my employment, research, or others activities please contact me by filling out the form below.

Best regards,
Wyatt</p>
