</p> My name is Wyatt Dudgeon. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan at the Ross School of Business pursuing my Bachelors of Business Administration (BBA) with a concentration in Finance. I am also pursuig a minor in entrepreneurship catalyzed by my acceptence into the Entrepreneurship Leadership Program (ELP) fellowship with the College of Engineering. </p>

</p> I seek to explore a career in finance or entrepreneurship. This past summer I had the opportunity to work with the Detroit Techstars Mobility accelerator, the mobility startup accelerator. I aspire to expand my knowledge within the mobility, tech, and financial space through a summer internship summer ‘19 </p>

</p> While at Michigan I am presently working on several projects. Firstly, I am working closely with the Genivi Automotive Alliance compiling a database to track the progress of autonomous vehicle development of large automotive manufacturers, technology industry leaders, and first tier suppliers. I am also engaged in research with Dr. David Brophy, the director of venture capital and private equity at the Ross School of Business, in regards to the correlation of high quality mentorship and a startup’s success. Thirdly, I was recently employed as a university analyst at Plug and Play Tech-center, a large network startup accelerator and corporate innovation platform, to deal source Midwestern hardware and advanced mobility solution startups.</p>

</p> Additiontionally, I adore the Detroit entrepneurial community. It has forged me into who I am today and I owe everything to the city.
